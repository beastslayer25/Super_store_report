# Super_store_report

ðŸ“Š Completed a Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard in Power BI!
Body:

I'm excited to share a recent Power BI project focused on analyzing the Superstore sales dataset. This dashboard was designed to transform complex data into clear, actionable insights for business leaders.
Key features include:

Performance Matrix: A custom visual that compares Sales vs. Profit across different categories and segments.

Regional Insights: A map chart and bar charts that allow for a detailed breakdown of sales and profit by Region, State, and Zone.

Temporal Analysis: Slicers to filter the data by Year and Month to identify sales trends and seasonal patterns.

Interactive Design: The dashboard is built with a user-friendly interface, allowing stakeholders to easily explore data and make informed decisions.
This project further enhanced my skills in data modeling, DAX, and creating professional, impactful data visualizations.
